# 2 - Project Description
Goal
  - improve your programming skills with Python
  - focus more on the Python and worry less about the image classifier

Description
  - create registration system for dog show
  - people should register pets with photo and description
  - use already trained classifier to ensure participants are dogs

Tasks
  - determine which classifier algorithm works best for classifying dogs
  - determine how well the best algorithm works
  - time how long each algorithm takes to solve the problem

Notes
  - image classification program here will use a "convolutional neural network" (CNN)
  - CNNs are good at detecting image features (color, texture, edges) and using those to determine what the image is
  - explore 3 different CNN architectures and determine which is best for our application:
    - AlexNet
    - VGG
    - ResNet

# 3 - Project Instructions
Principal Objectives
  - correctly identify images of dogs
  - correctly classify breed of dog (if image is dog)
  - determine which CNN model best achieves #1 and #2
  - Consider time resources and decide if alternative solution would be 'good enough'

To Do
  - edit `check_images.py` to create the currently undefined functions needed to achieve the objectives
  - for additional guidance check files that end in `_hints.py`
